This is a work in progress and should not be considered safe or stable.
It currently depends on [libxdrfile](https://github.com/wesbarnett/libxdrfile), which is no longer maintained.
I may create a fork for stability in future, or maybe just reimplement the whole thing in rust.

For now, it provides bare bones functionality to read/write basic .xtc files.
